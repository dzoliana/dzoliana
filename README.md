I'm Ana, a tech enthusiast who loves to learn about new things.
I love making and designing webpages with React. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on CroQCI crypto network development project, and creating webpages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js.
- 🛠️ My tech toolkit includes JavaScript, React, NextJS, Redux, Typescript, TanstackQuery... 
- 😀 I like painting, video editing and dancing in my free time.
